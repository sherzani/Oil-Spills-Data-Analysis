# Oil-Spills-Data-Analysis

## Introduction 
Oil spills are a major natural disaster. They cause extreme environmental damage, spread pollution which can make people susceptible to diseases such as cancer, and are a huge financial burden. By keeping track of these cases, we have the ability to figure out what might have caused them in the first place and potentially minimize, if not fully prevent the destruction they cause. For these reasons, we designed a database for oil spills. 
We are using a dataset sponsored by the Department of Transportation called “Oil Pipeline Accidents, 2010 - Present” from Kaggle. The dataset includes each pipeline leak and oil spill that has been reported to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration from 2010-2017. Here is the link for the full dataset: Oil Spill Accidents (2010-2017).
We used 20 oil spills from November and December of 2016. For this reason, only a portion of its capabilities can be observed from the queries. However, our client, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would still find the queries in this paper interesting for the time period we chose. 

## Database 
The database was developed however, Github does not allow for an image to be uploaded here. 

## Sample Data
We started with thousands of observations from 2010-2017 but limited our scope to 20 oil spills from the months of November and December of 2016. Since we manually imported data into each excel sheet (corresponding to each table), a smaller number of observations made the process of data import much less time-intensive. 

## Queries

- Who are the operators that intentionally released barrels? Also, how many barrels did they release?
- How many barrels of oil spilled or were released in December of 2016? 
- What were the totals of the different types of costs from 2016-11-30 to 2016-12-15?
- For each cost type, which reports are the most devastating monetarily? (devastating as in greater than average for each cost type)
- What differences are there between accidents below and above average commodity cost? 

## Potential Future Work
In the future, we would use data over a larger time range to discover trends over a specified period of time. This information would be interesting for our stakeholders such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would want to understand these trends to create policy and laws for operators. A comparison of spills by region would also be useful for congress to funnel resources in certain regions.
